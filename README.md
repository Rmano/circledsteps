See [this question on tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/7032/good-way-to-make-textcircled-numbers)

### DOCUMENTATION

See the included file `circledsteps-manual.tex`; you can compile it running (twice) `pdflatex` on it.

If you have already installed the package in your TeX distribution, use `texdoc circledsteps`; it should show you the manual of the installed version of the package.
